## How we work

Content designers in DfE follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">the 14 point Service Standard (opens in new tab)</a>

Our skills particularly focus on these Standards: 

1. understand users and their needs
2. solve a whole problem for users
3. provide a joined up experience across all channels
4. make the service simple to use
5. make sure everyone can use the service
8. iterate and improve frequently
10. define what success looks like and publish performance data 
11. choose the right tools and technology

We work closely with the other <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#user-centred-design-job-family", "user-centred design (UCD) professionals")%>  on our team, including user researchers, service and interaction designers, along with business analysts and developers to meet these Standards.

## How we meet the Service Standard

As a content design profession, we agree to:

- evidence and document how we make design decisions <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/research-and-evidence", "(tools and evidence to back up content design decisions) ")%>
- ensure content is accessible <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction", "(making your service accessible)")%>
- use the appropriate style and brand guide for the service or website 
- have a process in place to preview prior to publishing, such as a 2i, quality check and sign off content
- work to a strategy, and publish <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-proposition/govuk-proposition", "a proposition statement - example for GOV.UK")%> where appropriate
- test with users through user research and by building prototypes
- work in collaboration with our user-centred design and policy colleagues to understand problems and create solutions
- always develop content that meets user needs
- set performance measures and monitor content against these measures <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success", "(measuring success)")%> 
- have a plan in place to continuously iterate and improve
- work to the <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/service-manual", "service manual standards")%>
- work to the <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-proposition", "GOV.UK proposition")%>, where applicable 


## We follow government guidance 

As a starting point, we use:

- <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service/about", "Government Digital Service")%> (GDS) build platforms, products and services for government
- <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/central-digital-and-data-office/about", "Central Digital & Data Office")%> manage standards and service assessments for government. This includes the digital, data and technology function (DDaT) framework
- <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide", "GDS style guide")%>  
- <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/topic/government-digital-guidance/content-publishing", "GDS content and publishing guidance")%>  
- <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/service-manual", "GDS Service Manual")%>  


## We also follow DfE guidance

We use DfE specific guidance when considering things like tone of voice, specific styles and how to publish in DfE.

<%= external_link("https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications.aspx", "How to communicate")%> is a section of our intranet that explains how we communicate at DfE, it includes:

- working with strategic and digital communications teams
- brand guidelines, including guidance on images and videos and document templates
- DfE style guide
- how to publish on GOV.UK
- how to produce content for different channels, such as our blogs or presentation for internal and external use
- <%= external_link("https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-make-your-content-accessible.aspx", "make your content accessible")%>

We have a <%= external_link("https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-dfe-govuk-content-strategy.aspx", "DfE content strategy")%> template, which should form the basis of individual product and service strategies.
