## When to use this pattern

This interaction allows a user to add single or multiple items, check they are correct and provide an option to add more. This pattern can be used to add people to an application, add items to a list or upload files.

Follow this pattern:

to help confirm an action
to allow the user to change their minds
when the action is not easily reversible
when the completion immediately starts another process

## How it works

When adding multiple items of the same thing, the pattern should:

remember previous choices
give clear guidance on the flexibility of choices
