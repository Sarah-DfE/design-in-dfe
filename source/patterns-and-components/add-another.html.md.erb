## When to use this pattern

This interaction allows a user to add single or multiple items, check they are correct and provide an option to add more. This pattern can be used to add people to an application, add items to a list or upload files.

Follow this pattern:

- to enable users to add multiple things of the same type
- to help confirm an action
- to allow the user to change their minds
- when the action is not easily reversible
- when the completion immediately starts another process

## How it works

When adding multiple items of the same thing, the pattern should:

- remember previous choices
- give clear guidance on what the user can do
